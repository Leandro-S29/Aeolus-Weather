## 🛣️ Roadmap
- Project after completing basic features will be put on hold, as I will recreate the same in Flutter/Dart to learn Dart and create a cross-platform application with better functionalities and UI.

## 🧠 Use of AI:
- Image Logo was generated using Gemini AI by Google.

## 🌐 Other:
- Icons made by [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

## 📖 Note: 
This project is using a deprecated (But functional, in early 2026) API path from OpenWeatherMap.
I'm using this because the new API path even though is being worked on, i felt like there was some problems with the data that was being retrieved.
